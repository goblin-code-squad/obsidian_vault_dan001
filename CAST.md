The `CAST()` function has the same simple syntax across all SQL dialects:

`CAST(_value_ AS _type_)`

- _value_ can be any valid SQL value. It could be a column name, the result of a calculation, the result of a function, or a literal value.
- _type_ is the desired data type, i.e. what you want the value converted into.
